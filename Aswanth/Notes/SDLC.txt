SDLC:
1. Requirement Phase:
      Gather the details from the clients and gather the requirements according to it. 

      It has 2 types of requirements (1) Functional Requirements (2) Non Functional Requirements
                 (1)Functional Requirements - What the system should do - "User can log in", "Admin can add
                                                                                                 a product"
                 (2)Non-Functional Requirements - How the system should be - "Should load in 2 seconds",
                                                                             "Must be secure", "Should
                                                                              support 1 million users"  

      Key People Involved:
         Business Analyst (BA) - The main person collecting and documenting requirements
         Client / Stakeholder - The person or group who needs the software
         Project Manager (PM) - Ensures requirement phase sticks to time/budget

      SRS(Software Requirements Specification) plays a key role in this phase and it acts like a blueprint.
      It documents everything and helps to create a overview of the system. It contains diagrams like class
      diagram, usecase diagram,  sequence diagram. It acts as the single source of truth for developers,
      testers, designers and stakeholders. 
 
      Final Summary:
      Phase Name ----> Requirement Gathering and Analysis
      Goal ----> Understand and document what the software should do
      People Involved ----> Client, Business Analyst, PM, Devs, QA
      Techniques Used ----> Interviews, Surveys, Observations, Prototypes, Use Cases
      Tools Used ----> Google Forms, Figma, Lucidchart, MS Word, Excel
      Output Docs ----> SRS, BRD, Use Case Diagram, RTM
      Importance ----> Lays the foundation for success or failure of the project
